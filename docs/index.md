# C-scores

## What are C-scores?

C-scores quantify whether genes show **common** or **divergent** responses across two different comparisons:

- **Positive C-scores**: Genes respond in the same direction (both up or both down)
- **Negative C-scores**: Genes respond in opposite directions (up in one, down in another)
- **Zero/near-zero C-scores**: No relationship or independent responses
- **Magnitude**: Larger absolute values indicate stronger commonness/divergence
